- 👋 Hi, I’m @applehoro
- 👀 I’m interested in game development, game design and related stuff
- 🌱 I’m currently learning modelling, writing and some other skill I'm not quite proficient at the time
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on games and, probably, game engines
- 📫 How to reach me:
- [@applehoro](github.com/applehoro)
- [itch.io](https://run-hanako.itch.io/)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have two cats, Musya and Breadloaf. Musya is pretty much a little princess, quite restrained and not very social, prefering to spend her time on her own. Breadloaf, on the other hand, is my little chunky teddybear, always love pets and spend every night cuddling with me in my bed. Love both of them with my whole heart :3
